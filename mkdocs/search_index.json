            "text": "Upgrading to Will 2.0\n\n\n\nWill was born four years ago, and 0.x and 1.x lived long, good lives.\n\n\nBut as the years passed, there were increasing concerns about HipChat lock-in, and it was time to make Will smarter.  \n\n\nSo six months ago, work on Will 2.0 began, and today it's finally here! All of our Wills are free from lock-in, future-proofed, and whole lot smarter.  If you're just hearing about this, it's worth a quick read of the \nrelease announcement\n for a bit more context!\n\n\nThe Short Version: Just pip install\n\n\nWhile Will has picked up a bunch of features and improvements in 2.0, we've aimed to keep him backwards-compatable with 1.x and 0.x releases.  If you weren't using any undocumented internal methods and you're already using redis, upgrading should be as easy as:\n\n\npip install --upgrade will\n\n\n\n\nFrom there, you can just \n./run_will.py\n, and things should Just Work.\n\n\nYou will, however, see a lot of output from Will, telling you that some names have changed, and asking you to update them in your \nconfig.py\n when you have time.  You can either just follow those instructions, or the guide below.\n\n\nThe Long Version:\n\n\n1. Add IO backends.\n\n\nIf you're planning to continue only using HipChat (until it's replaced by Stride), we'd recommend that you add this to your \nconfig.py\n:\n\n\nIO_BACKENDS = [\n    \nwill.backends.io_adapters.hipchat\n,\n    \nwill.backends.io_adapters.shell\n,\n    # \nwill.backends.io_adapters.slack\n,\n    # \nwill.backends.io_adapters.rocketchat\n,\n]\n\n\n\n\nThat will enable the HipChat and local shell stdin/stdout backend, for easy testing. \n\n\nIf you want to also bring your Will into a Slack or Rocket.Chat room in the future, just uncomment that backend and restart!\n\n\n2. Update the HipChat tokens to be namespaced.\n\n\nYou'll see this starting up, but when you have time, update your tokens as follows:\n\n(If you're using \nWILL_\n environment variables, please add the \nWILL_\n as needed:)\n\n\n\n\nUSERNAME\n becomes \nHIPCHAT_USERNAME\n\n\nTOKEN\n or \nV1_TOKEN\n become \nHIPCHAT_V1_TOKEN\n\n\nV2_TOKEN\n becomes \nHIPCHAT_V2_TOKEN\n\n\nDEFAULT_ROOM\n becomes \nHIPCHAT_DEFAULT_ROOM\n\n\nHANDLE\n should be removed, as it's now pulled live from the HipChat servers and not used.\n\n\nNAME\n should be removed, as it's now pulled live from the HipChat servers and not used.\n\n\nPASSWORD\n becomes \nHIPCHAT_PASSWORD\n\n\nROOMS\n becomes \nHIPCHAT_ROOMS\n\n\n\n\n3. Set up Redis\n\n\nAt the moment, Redis is the only working pubsub backend, and is required to run Will. So, if you're not already running it, you'll need it for 2.x.\n\n\nIf this is impossible for your setup, ZeroMQ support is in the works, and we're looking to add a pure-python backend as well in 2.1 or 2.2.  Creating a new pubsub backend just requires subclassing \nBasePubSub\n and implementing four methods - so if someone has a little time to bring those along, a pull request is welcome!\n\n\n4. Set your encryption secret key.\n\n\nWill now encrypts all messages on the pubsub wire and in storage by default.  Without a \nSECRET_KEY\n set, he'll auto-generate one based on the machine MAC address, but this isn't a perfect solution, and will mean that he can't access his storage if there are hardware changes (or he's running in a virtualized environment that has shifting MACs.)\n\n\nPlease set \nSECRET_KEY\n as soon as possible.\n\n\nThe recommended way is to set it as an environmental variable, \nWILL_SECRET_KEY\n, in an environment that is secured and you trust.  Any string will work, and entropy is good. \n\n\n5. Set the new 2.0 settings to your liking.\n\n\nWill 2 ships with bunch of new features, and though we've provided sensible defaults, if you'd like, you can update your \nconfig.py\n with your preferences.\n\n\nThe simplest way to see everything is to have Will generate a \nconfig.py.dist\n that you can use for comparison:\n\n\n$ generate_will_project --config-dist-only\n...\nCreated a config.py.dist.  Open it up to see what's new!\n\n\n\n\nIt's worth reading through the new \nconfig.py\n, but here's a few areas specifically worth a look:\n\n\nPlatform and Decision-making\n\n\nAs mentioned above, there are now multiple IO backends and platforms that Will can communicate on. It's also now easy to \nwrite your own\n, pull requests are very welcome, and more are coming soon.  Here's all the options:\n\n\nIO_BACKENDS = [\n    \nwill.backends.io_adapters.slack\n,\n    \nwill.backends.io_adapters.hipchat\n,\n    \nwill.backends.io_adapters.rocketchat\n,\n    \nwill.backends.io_adapters.shell\n,\n]\n\n\n\n\nWill 2 also comes with pluggable brains - split into Analysis, Generation, and Execution backends.  The defaults are solid and behave similarly to Will 1.0 (the only difference is a high-confidence fuzzy matching engine), but if you're interested in making your Will more flexible, or adding more context to his responses, building \ncustom backends is easy\n.\n\n\nHere's all of the options, with the defaults uncommented.   It's worth pulling this into your \nconfig.py\n.\n\n\n# Backends to analyze messages and generate useful metadata\nANALYZE_BACKENDS = [\n    \nwill.backends.analysis.nothing\n,\n    \nwill.backends.analysis.history\n,\n]\n\n# Backends to generate possible actions, and metadata about them.\nGENERATION_BACKENDS = [\n    \nwill.backends.generation.strict_regex\n,\n    \nwill.backends.generation.fuzzy_all_matches\n,\n    # \nwill.backends.generation.fuzzy_best_match\n,\n]\n\n# The \ndecision making\n backends that look among the generated choices,\n# and decide which to follow. Backends are executed in order, and any\n# backend can stop further evaluation.\nEXECUTION_BACKENDS = [\n    \nwill.backends.execution.best_score\n,\n    # \nwill.backends.execution.all\n,\n]\n\n\n\n\nThere are also a few settings to tweak things like the fuzzy logic.  These have sensible defaults, but you can tweak them to your liking.\n\n\n# Confidence fuzzy generation backends require before Will responds\n# https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fuzzywuzzy\nFUZZY_MINIMUM_MATCH_CONFIDENCE = 90  # Defaults to 90%\nFUZZY_REGEX_ALLOWABLE_ERRORS = 3\n\n\n\n\n6. That's it - let us know how it goes!\n\n\nThat's all you really need to know to flip the switch to Will 2.0.  \n\n\nAs there's a lot of new stuff in this release, it's possible that some bugs have slipped through the cracks.  Please submit anything you find, no matter how small, \ninto the github issue tracker\n.  We'll be active in fixing things ASAP and helping if you're stuck.\n\n\nThanks for using Will, and for going through the big upgrade!  We're excited about what the future holds, and happy to get your bots free from platform lock-in.\n\n\nIf you'd like to do a deeper dive into what's new, check out the documentation \non Will's new brain\n.",

Since he already comes with \"hello\", and \"hi\", in this example, we'll go with \"bonjour!\"\n\n\nStep 1: Create a bonjour.py\n\n\nThis file can be called anything, but given the functionality, bonjour seems like a fair name.  Create the file in your plugins folder:\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Add the plugin python code\n\n\nIn the \nbonjour.py\n file, add this:\n\n\nfrom will.plugin import WillPlugin\nfrom will.decorators import respond_to, periodic, hear, randomly, route, rendered_template, require_settings\n\n\nclass BonjourPlugin(WillPlugin):\n\n    @respond_to(\nbonjour\n)\n    def say_bonjour_will(self, message):\n        \nbonjour: I know how to say bonjour!

To use it:\n\n\nconfig.py:\n\n\nHELLO_MESSAGE = \nBonjour from config.py\n\n\n\n\n\nor, on the shell:\n\n\n# note the `WILL_` prefix\nexport WILL_HELLO_MESSSAGE=\nBonjour from the environment\n\n\n\n\n\nthen, in any plugin: \n\n\nfrom will import settings\n\nclass BonjourPlugin(WillPlugin):\n\n    @respond_to(\nbonjour\n)\n    def say_bonjour_will(self, message):\n        self.reply(settings.HELLO_MESSAGE)\n\n\n\n\nYou can also mark one or more settings as required for your plugin with the \nrequire_settings\n decorator, and they'll be checked on startup.\n\n\nfrom will import settings\n\nclass BonjourPlugin(WillPlugin):\n\n    @require_settings(\nHELLO_MESSAGE\n, \nANOTHER_SETTING\n)\n    @respond_to(\nbonjour\n)\n    def say_bonjour_will(self, message):\n        self.reply(settings.HELLO_MESSAGE)\n\n\n\n\nWhen will starts up, he'll make sure they've been set:\n\n\n\n\nGetting a room's history\n\n\nSometimes you'll want to retrieve a room's history. No problem - get the room's object, and the last 20 messages are sitting on \nanalysis.history\n.\n\n\nclass HistoryPlugin(WillPlugin):\n\n    @respond_to(\n^get last message\n)\n    def get_history(self, message):\n        room = self.get_room_from_message(message)\n        self.reply(room.analysis[\nhistory\n][-1])\n\n\n\n\nParse natural time\n\n\nOften, it's useful to be able to talk to will about time in natural language.  To make that easy, will includes the helper functions built on \nparsedatetime\n and \nnatural\n: \nself.parse_natural_time\n and \nself.to_natural_day_and_time\n.\n\n\nparse_natural_time\n\n\nself.parse_natural_time(time_string)\n parses a textual time string, and returns a \ndatetime\n object.\n\n\n@respond_to(\nremind me on (?P\nremind_time\n.*)\n)\ndef remind_me_at(self, message, remind_time=None):\n    parsed_time = self.parse_natural_time(remind_time)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto_natural_day_and_time\n\n\nself.to_natural_day_and_time(my_datetime)\n converts a python \ndatetime\n into a human-friendly string.\n\n\n@respond_to(\nshow_reminders\n)\ndef remind_me_at(self, message, remind_time=None):\n    reminders = self.load(\nreminders\n)\n    for r in reminders:\n        natural_time = self.to_natural_day_and_time(r)\n        self.say(\nOn %s\n % natural_time)\n\n\n\n\nNow you've got the hang of how to write your own plugins - but before you reinvent the wheel, take a look at \nwhat plugins are included in will\n!",

Maybe you are too. Or your clients are.  Or the light/dark cycle of the world just fascinates you.  If any of these are you, just ask Will to get the time in pretty much any city on earth.  Even our globe-trotting CEO hasn't been able to stump him.\n\n\n\n\nVersion\n\n\nProvides information about the release version of @will.\n\n\n\n\n@will version\n: Show the current running version.\n\n\n\n\nWeb\n\n\nThis module's all about web-facing content.\n\n\nHome page\n\n\nWill also includes a home page, so you can fire him, up, browse to his URL, and see his smiling face.\n\n\n\n\nYou now know everything about plugins.

            "text": "Deploying your Will\n\n\nWill's happy to run on your machine all day, every day.  But he really shines out in production where he can run independently of anything you do with your local machine.  Here are some best practices for deploying will.\n\n\nDeploy on Heroku\n\n\nHeroku is our recommended platform for deployment because it's simple, easy, and free. That's a tough combination to beat.  You're in no way locked in to running will on heroku, though - run him wherever you want!\n\n\nStep 1: Set up your heroku app, and a redis addon.\n\n\nAssuming you have the \nheroku toolbelt\n installed and all set up, it's as easy as this:\n\n\nheroku create our-will-name\nheroku addons:add rediscloud\n\n\n\n\nA note on rediscloud: you can also use redistogo, openredis, or anyone else.  We use rediscloud and like them.\n\n\nStep 2: Add all the needed environment variables:\n\n\nYou'll want to take all the variables that live in your virtualenv's \npostactivate\n file that feed into your will environment, and provide them to your heroku app.\n\n\nAt minimum, that's\n\n\nheroku config:set \\\nWILL_PUBLIC_URL=\nhttp://our-will-name.herokuapp.com\n \\\n# Slack\nWILL_SLACK_API_TOKEN=\nlkasjflkaklfjlasfjal1249814\n\n# Hipchat\nWILL_HIPCHAT_USERNAME='12345_123456@chat.hipchat.com' \\\nWILL_HIPCHAT_PASSWORD='asj2498q89dsf89a8df' \\\nWILL_HIPCHAT_V2_TOKEN='asdfjl234jklajfa3azfasj3afa3jlkjiau' \\\n# Rocket.Chat\nWILL_ROCKETCHAT_USERNAME='will@heywill.io'\\\nWILL_ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD='12o312938asfjilasdlfjasdlkfj'\\\nWILL_ROCKETCHAT_URL='https://heywill.rocket.chat'\\\n\n\n\n\nFinally, for will's schedule to be correct, you need to set him to the time zone you want:\n\n\nheroku config:set TZ=\nAmerica/Los_Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n You don't have to worry about setting the \nREDIS_URL\n or \nHTTPSERVER_PORT\n.  Will auto-detects those and takes care of it.\n\n\nStep 3: Deploy!\n\n\nYou're all set to deploy your will. Ready? Go!\n\n\ngit push heroku\n\n\n\n\nYou app is now up on heroku.  Finally, turn it on!\n\n\nheroku scale web=1\n\n\nThat should be it - head over to \nhttp://our-will-name.herokuapp.com\n, and you should see will's smiling face.\n\n\nIf so, pop into chat, and give a:\n\n\n\n\nDeploying future updates\n\n\nJust commit your updates, then\n\n\ngit push heroku\n\n\n\n\nSimple.  For best-practices, see our continuous deployment recommendations below.\n\n\nDeploy in Docker\n\n\nWill is packaged with a Dockerfile and docker-compose files to allow deploying in a container with redis.\n\n\nPre-requisites\n\n\nYou should have docker already installed; additionally, the instructions require docker-compose.  If you're not using docker-compose, you can still also the \npre-defined images from Docker Hub\n. \n\n\nStep 1: Configure your container's environment variables\n\n\nIn Will's docker directory, update the default.env file with your environment's settings.  At a minimum, this should contain:\n\n\n# For Slack\nWILL_SLACK_API_TOKEN\n# For Hipchat\nWILL_HIPCHAT_USERNAME\nWILL_HIPCHAT_PASSWORD\nWILL_HIPCHAT_V2_TOKEN\n# Rocket.Chat\nWILL_ROCKETCHAT_USERNAME\nWILL_ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD\nWILL_ROCKETCHAT_URL\n\n\n\n\nNote, we've pre-defined the redis url and the HTTP Server port; if you update these values, make sure you update the docker-compose file accordingly.\n\n\nStep 2: Deploy your plugins and templates\n\n\nIf you have any custom templates, create directories for your plugins and templates, and load your plugins and templates they'll be mounted when the container starts up giving your containerized bot access to your templates.\n\n\nmkdir ./plugins ./templates\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Build will.\n\n\nRun build your docker image locally.\n\n\ndocker-compose build\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Start the container\n\n\nStart your image from docker-compose using:\n\n\ndocker-compose up\n\n\n\n\nor to run the container in the background,\n\n\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n\n\n\nRoll your Own Container\n\n\nWill docker file(s) are part of the main repository; this lets developers/teams\nbuild on the containers to embed configuration files, custom plugins etc... For\nnow Will containers are represented in python 2.7 and python 3 flavors.\n\n\nWill-base\n\n\nWill is built on the alpine distribution(s) of python docker images. This was done\nto provide the smallest container footprint; yet, nothing is perfect so a few\nthings need to be added.  Will-base provides the foundation to perform these base\nmodifications.  \n\n\nWill\n\n\nThe heywill/will image is the container with Will executing as the\ncontainer process.  A build args are available for branch based builds from a\nrepository.  To build from a specific repo and branch use, \n\n\n--build-arg repo=\nrepo_name\n branch=\nbranch_name\n\n\n\n\n\notherwise skoczen/will is the default repo, while  master is the default branch.\n\n\nDeploy Everywhere Else\n\n\nWill is Just Python\n\n\nThat says it all. Will is just python, and you can deploy him \nanywhere\n you have python, an open port, and access to redis.\n\n\nIn your chosen deploy environment and setup, you'll want to do a couple things:\n\n\nReplicate your environment settings\n\n\nAt minimum, that's:\n\n\nexport WILL_PUBLIC_URL=\nhttp://our-will-name.herokuapp.com\n\nexport WILL_REDIS_URL='redis://some-domain.com/7/'\nexport WILL_HTTPSERVER_PORT='80'\n\n# Slack\nWILL_SLACK_API_TOKEN=\nlkasjflkaklfjlasfjal1249814\n\n# Hipchat\nexport WILL_HIPCHAT_USERNAME='12345_123456@chat.hipchat.com'\nexport WILL_HIPCHAT_PASSWORD='asj2498q89dsf89a8df'\nexport WILL_HIPCHAT_V2_TOKEN='asdfjl234jklajfa3azfasj3afa3jlkjiau'\n# Rocket.Chat\nWILL_ROCKETCHAT_USERNAME='will@heywill.io'\nWILL_ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD='12o312938asfjilasdlfjasdlkfj'\nWILL_ROCKETCHAT_URL='https://heywill.rocket.chat'\n\n\n\n\nIf you have more than 30 chat rooms, you must also set the V1 token to avoid hipchat rate limits:\n\n\nexport WILL_HIPCHAT_V1_TOKEN='kjadfj89a34878adf78789a4fae3'\n\n\n\n\nYou'll also need to set any environment variables for your plugins.\n\n\nCall run_will with something that handles restarts and crashes.\n\n\nThe command to kick off will is just:\n\n\npython run_will.py\n\n\n\n\nYou can run that with whatever supervisory process you'd like. Will's very, very stable, but having something that handles crashes is still a pretty good idea.\n\n\nAlternate approach\n\n\nAh, you say, but I have this crazy python-twisted-zope-node monolith that self-repairs mars and can do everything. Why do I need the shell at all?\n\n\nAnswer, crazy monolith mars person: you don't.  Will is Just Python.\n\n\nfrom will.main import WillBot\n\nbot = WillBot()\nbot.bootstrap()\n\n\n\n\nand you're good.\n\n\nStorage Backends\n\n\nWill's default storage backend is Redis, but he supports some others if you can't run Redis.\n\n\nTo change the backend, just set \nSTORAGE_BACKEND\n in \nconfig.py\n and then supply any other needed settings for the new storage backend.  The currently supported backends are:\n\n\n\n\nredis\n - The default Redis backend\n\n\ncouchbase\n - A Couchbase backend\n\n\nfile\n - Keeps the settings as files on a local filesystem\n\n\n\n\nCouchbase\n\n\nCouchbase requries you set \nCOUCHBASE_URL\n in your config.\n\n\nYou are also required to have the python Couchbase client (and thus, libcouchbase) installed.  If you are installing for development you can use \npip install -r requirements.couchbase.txt\n to pull in the Couchbase client.  See \nthe Python Couchbase client repo\n for more info.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\nCOUCHBASE_URL='couchbase:///bucket'\n\n\nCOUCHBASE_URL='couchbase://hostname/bucket'\n\n\nCOUCHBASE_URL='couchbase://host1,host2/bucket'\n\n\nCOUCHBASE_URL='couchbase://hostname/bucket?password=123abc\ntimeout=5'\n\n\n\n\nFile\n\n\nFile requires you set \nFILE_DIR\n in your config to point to an empty directory.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\nFILE_DIR='/var/run/will/settings/'\n\n\nFILE_DIR='~will/settings/'\n\n\n\n\nPubsub Backends\n\n\nWill's default pubsub backend is Redis, and support for ZeroMQ and a pure-python backend is on the way.\n\n\nTo change the backend, just set \nPUBSUB_BACKEND\n in \nconfig.py\n and then supply any other needed settings for the new backend.  The currently supported backend is:\n\n\n\n\nredis\n - The default Redis backend\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices\n\n\nIn this section, we describe how we deploy and host will, in the hopes that others come forward and share what's working for them, too.  The more good practices, the better.\n\n\nOur Stack\n\n\nWe host on heroku, using rediscloud for redis, mailgun for email, and things have been peachy.  We deploy via CD using CircleCI. Details on that below.\n\n\nUse Continuous Deployment\n\n\nOur stack is set up so that any pushes on will's master branch have tests run on \nCircleCI\n, and if they pass, a new version is deployed to heroku immediately.  This has been delightful. Even though will has very, very minimal tests, we generally catch if things are horribly broken, and it's meant that adding new functionality to will takes minutes, sometimes seconds of developer time.\n\n\nContinuous Deployment has dramatically changed how we build and use will - instead of talking about \"what if will did...\", generally, people just implement it, push it, and play with it for real.  It's been a great place to be.  It might be for you too.\n\n\nThat's it in getting your will up and running!   But maybe you're one of those people who wants to pitch in and make will even better. Awesome. Learn \nhow to improve will\n.",

It's always great to get a heads up of what's coming down the pipe, and have an open dialog.  Thanks for reaching out and starting one!  In terms of the mechanics, you'll just want to:   Fork this repo.  Clone down a copy, set up redis and the env, as before.  Run  ./start_dev_will.py  to start up just core will.",

Bottle  for http handling,  Jinja  for templating,  Sleekxmpp  for listening to xmpp,  natural  and  parsedatetime  for natural date parsing,  apscheduler  for scheduled task parsing,  Requests  to make http sane.   Will was originally written and is maintained by  Steven Skoczen .  Credit to GreenKahuna (now defunct) and  BuddyUp  for supporting those efforts with on-the-job time.  Will's also has had help from lots of coders. Alphabetically:   acommasplice  fixed up the programmer help, so it works again.  adamcin  gave you html support in 1-1 chats, using the new v2 API, and made bootstrapping more reliable.  adamgilman  gave you the friendly error messages when the hipchat key was invalid.  antgel  fixed the image plugin, for reals and added awesome documentation.  amckinley  fixed a bug in the hipchat user list from missing params.  bfhenderson  removed dependence on the v1 token, and made help more friendly.  borgstrom  gave you beautifully architected storage backends, including support for couchbase and local storage.  brandonsturgeon  jumped on hipchat's API-breaking change, and made will immune in a flash.  Improved the docs all over, too.  BrianGallew  improved the blacklist import mechanism, so blacklisted modules aren't even attempted to be imported, taught will to handle zombie users with grace, and fixed the file storage backend.  bsvetchine  fixed a bug with README generation.  buran  added HTML support to 1-1 messages.  carsongee  pooled your redis connections.  camilonova  fixed the  @randomly  decorator, and brought the joy of more pugs to your life.  He's also reported several important bugs.  ckcollab  was one of the original contributors, when will was first built at GreenKahuna.  charlax  gave us batch-get of rooms via the V2 API.  chillipeper  fixed up the max-size and handling of V2 rooms, and taught will how to use bottle's  custom_filters .  crccheck  gave you friendly error messages if your  WILL_ROOMS  was wrong.  d0ugal  fixed up the docs to meet the new mkdocs standard.  danbourke  submitted a fix for the  2000 rooms bug, and kept Will happy.  derek-adair  found a solution for the duplicated 'hi' messages.  dpoirier  figured out how to properly ignore the initial catch-up messages, and gave you log-level control.  dmuntean  gave you proxy support, and kept it working..  hobson  made setup.py more robust across operating systems, and improved the docs.  Ironykins  brought you urban dictionary support.  kenden  fixed up the redis docs for ubuntu/debian.  jbeluch  found a bug with  get_roster  not populating in time.  jcdyer  made the  _available_rooms  object consistent across API versions.  jessamynsmith  was kind enough to port  talkbackbot  over, at my request, then kept it updated through version changes.  jquast  did the noble and oft unappreciated work of spelling fixes.  keNzi  added shorten url function using bitly service.  levithomason  was one of the original contributors, when will was first built at GreenKahuna.  mark-adams  cleaned up a Bitbucket typo.  mattcl  taught will to reconnect to Slack when hiccups occur.  mike-love  added Docker support to make running Will easier - and then re-updated it to support Will 2.x!  hobson  made setup.py more robust across operating systems, and improved the docs.  neronmoon  made it easier to mention will with non-standard case  michaeljoseph  suggested improvements to setup and requirements.txt format.  mrgrue  added support for the hipchat server beta.  mvanbaak  brought you support for bitbucket uptime.  netjunkie  fixed a duplicated help module, added an expire parameter to  self.save() , added support for will watching hipchat's status, fixed some redis config bugs, and kept word game working on py3.  ostracon  got chat room replies working for orgs with   1000 rooms.  pcurry  added travis support.  pepedocs  added friendly timestamps to the default logging output.  PrideRage  gave you access to a room's entire history, and suggested a better talkback regex.  quixeybrian  wrote the awesome new help system and stopped the rate limit nightmare.  Regner  upgraded the hiredis version to work on windows.  rbp  added the  admin_only  argument, and fixed a bug with  room  not being passed along properly to messages.  shadow7412  cleaned up a bunch of regex, and fixed up  image me  after google pulled the free API.  sivy  added a config flag for disabling SSL, and the ability to look up a user by nickname.  tenzer  added python 3 support!  tomokas  fixed a bug in the  @randomly  decorator.  tophsic  made help friendlier, including plugin-specific help.  @TaunoTinits  fixed the  get_room_from_message  method in 2.x.  wohali  tracked down the annoying DNS thread issue, and got will on the right path.  woohgit  added support for the v2 WorldWeatherOnline API, and fixed it when I broke it, and then fixed it again when they changed their endpoint.  He also taught will how to say his version number.  And  remind ___ to ___ at ___ .  Awesome. And fixed lots of docs.  And put the time zone with \"what time is it?\".  And then added an entire Pagerduty workflow.  And made message parsing more reliable.  And wrote the ACL support.  And even more doc fixes. And improvements on uptime monitoring edge cases. And kept Pagerduty working. And added  append  and  pop  list support. And ditched WorldWeatherOnline when it started to hurt. Yep.  wontonst  made it simple to have will reply to a specific room, made reminders more friendly, and kept py2/3 compatability working on HipChat.  woparry  made sure that Will could handle organizations with a massive ( 2000) number of rooms.",

Props to \n@cmachine\n for also submitting a fix.\n\n\nSaying \"G\" will no longer give you a picture of a pug, using the default settings. This is both tragic, and necessary. (Actual fix: adjusted default fuziness settings.  If you have the fuzzy backend on, and were seeing the rather hilarious/annoying \n#327\n, set \nFUZZY_MINIMUM_MATCH_CONFIDENCE = 91\n in your config.py)\n\n\nProgrammer help is working again, thanks to \n@acommasplice\n.\n\n\nFixes word game to work in python 3 thanks to \n@netjunki\n, and \nptomkiel-oktawave\n's report.\n\n\nFixes up chat room rosters in HipChat with rosters \n 1000 rooms, thanks to \n@ostracon\n\n\nFixes \nget_room_from_message\n, thanks to \n@TaunoTinits\n's fix and  \nptomkiel-oktawave\n's report.\n\n\nFixes an error that could occur on incoming webhooks on hipchat.  Thanks to \nptomkiel-oktawave\n and others for a report.\n\n\nFixes Will incorrectly talking to the main slack room, when he's directly addressed in 1-1 with something he doesn't know how to do.  Thanks to \nnetjunki\n for the report!\n\n\n\n\n2.1.0 - November 28, 2017\n\n\nPlanned release that includes:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic \ndocker hub builds\n thanks to \n@mike-love\n\n\nUpgrades to use base markdownify package, as the proposed changes have been \nmerged and released\n.\n\n\nNew fabric commands to manage docker builds and releases.\n\n\n\n\n2.0.2 - November 22, 2017\n\n\nBugfix release that fixes:\n\n\n\n\nWill once again joins all hipchat rooms \nHIPCHAT_ROOMS\n was not specified.  Thanks to \nvissree\n for finding and reporting this bug!\n\n\n\n\n2.0.1 - November 21, 2017\n\n\nSame release as 2.0.1, removes beta tag.\n\n\n2.0.1beta4 - November 20, 2017\n\n\nBugfix release that fixes:\n\n\n\n\ncolor\n parameter wasn't working properly in Slack.\n\n\nFixes up slack escaping, to support \nslack formatted|https://example.com\n links.  Thanks to \n@netjunki\n for the report on this and the above.\n\n\n\n\nMinor features:\n* Adds a new \nstart_thread\n parameter to \nsay()\n and \nreply()\n to allow Will to start slack threads.\n\n\n2.0.1beta3 - November 13, 2017\n\n\nBugfix release that fixes:\n\n\n\n\nHigh CPU in some setups, thanks to \nmattcl\n for the report and debuggging!\n\n\nUpdates to \nmarkdownify\n fork 0.4.1.\n\n\n\n\n2.0.1beta2 - November 9, 2017\n\n\nBugfix release that fixes:\n\n\n\n\nFixes \nscheduled_say\n breakage.\n\n\nImproves reminder plugins to capture and naturally handle \"to\"s, thanks to \nwontonst\n.\n\n\nGets docker builds working, thanks to \nmike-love\n.\n\n\n\n\n2.0.1beta1 - November 7, 2017\n\n\nTL;DR: Slack, Rocket.chat, and Shell support, and you can write full chatterbots with Will now!\n\n\nThis is a huge rewrite of will, adding pluggable backends for chat systems, Will's internal brains, pub-sub, and encryption.  \n\n\nA huge number of really smart people gave their thoughts and suggestions throughout the process, not least \n@hobson\n, \n@woohgit\n, \n@netjunki\n, \n@sivy\n, \n@antgel\n, \n@shadow7412\n, \n@brandonsturgeon\n, \n@pepedocs\n, \n@tophsic\n, and \n@mike-love\n.\n\n\nRead all about what and why here: \nWhat's new in Will 2\n,\n\n\nAnd when you're ready to upgrade, here's \nthe upgrade guide\n. (Spoiler: \npip install -U will\n).\n\n\nHigh-level, here's what's new:\n\n\n\n\nSlack support\n\n\nCLI/Shell backend\n\n\nRocket.chat\n support, thanks to \nantgel\n.\n\n\nWill's brains have been abstracted - you can now add custom \nanalysis\n, \ngeneration\n, and \nexecution\n backends to build everything from a straight regex-bot to a full chatterbot.\n\n\nPluggable I/O backends\n, which is how all of the above were done, and which means adding new platforms is pretty simple.\n\n\nPluggable storage\n backends.\n\n\nPluggable pubsub\n backends.\n\n\nBuilt-in encryption for storage and pub/sub (with \npluggable backends\n as well.)\n\n\nLots more intelligence around required settings and verification, to make first starting and debugging Will easier.\n\n\nFull Python 3 support. (Don't worry, 2.x \nisn't going anywhere\n.)\n\n\nNew \n@will gif me\n command.  Because it can't all be serious. :)\n\n\n\n\nThis release also changes a few bits of behavior, to be consistent:\n\n\n\n\nself.reply()\n \nfinally\n no longer requires you to tediously pass the \nmessage\n back to it.  It's also smart, and backwards compatable with existing plugins.\n\n\nadmin_only\n is explicitly flagged for deprecation and removal, to be replaced by the ACL system introduced in 2015 (largely, this is because having two different access control systems is crazy and painful.)  Switching is as easy as adding \nACL = {'admins': ['steven', 'will']}\n to your config.py and find/replacing \nadmin_only=True\n with `acl=['admins',] in your codebase.  For now, Will handles backwards compatibility by mapping the old settings into the new places, but he won't forever.  Thanks for updating, and making ongoing maintenence simpler!\n\n\nIf no ACLs are specified and users try to perform restricted commands, they'll be allowed as before, but Will will complain to the console. A new \nDISABLE_ACL\n setting has been added to turn off the complaining.\n\n\nYou can pass in \nchannel=\n or \nroom=\n when specifying a custom reply location.  If both are passed in, Will uses \nchannel\n.\n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple \ninternal\n backwards-incompatible changes:\n\n\n\n\nRosterMixin\n has been renamed \nHipChatRosterMixin\n and moved to \nwill.backends.io_adapters.hipchat\n.  This change should not affect you unless you were specifically importing RosterMixin in your own plugins - everything in \nWillPlugin\n has been automatically routed to the right place, in a backwards-compatible way.\n\n\nRoom\n and \nRoomMixin\n have similarly become \nHipChatRoom\n and \nHipChatRoomMixin and moved to\nwill.backends.io_adapters.hipchat`.\n\n\n\n\nAs this is a \nbig\n update, please report any bugs you see (no matter how small) to \nthe github issue tracker\n.  Thanks in advance for making Will even better!\n\n\n1.0.2 - October 24, 2017\n\n\nFixes and features in this release:\n\n\n\n\nMakes passing the \nroom=\n option \nmuch\n easier (you can just use the room's name now,) thanks to \nwontonst\n.\n\n\nAdds support for jinja \ncustom_filters\n in the \n@rendered_template\n decorator, thanks to \nchillipeper\n.\n\n\n\n\n1.0.1 - October 10, 2017\n\n\nFixes and features in this release:\n\n\n\n\nFixes what time plugin to not require World Weather's old API, thanks to \nwoohgit\n.\n\n\nAdds Docker support, thanks to \nmike-love\n.\n\n\nAdds Python 3 support, thanks to \ntenzer\n.\n\n\n\n\n1.0.0 - September 29, 2017\n\n\nThis is the end of major feature development for the hipchat-only version of Will.  Future development will be on 2.x, and while backwards compatability will be aimed for, it's not 100% guaranteed.\n\n\nFixes and features in this release:\n\n\n\n\nMakes ACLs be case-insensitive, thanks to \nwoohgit\n.\n\n\nAdds Hipchat card support, also thanks to \nwoohgit\n.\n\n\nGets Chatoms random topics working again, thanks to \nbykof\n.\n\n\nEnvironment overrides for \nPLUGINS\n and \nPLUGIN_BLACKLIST\n (semicolon separated) are now possible, thanks to \nmark-adams\n.\n\n\n\n\n0.9.5 - June 23, 2017\n\n\nQuick bugfix release before the big changeover to 1.0, pluggable backends (Slack support), and more.\n\n\n\n\nFixed: \n@will image me\n actually works again thanks to \nantgel\n.\n\n\n\n\n0.9.4 - April 25, 2017\n\n\nNew releases and movement again!  Exciting things in the pipeline for will, and that's starting with a long-awaited release.

            "text": "TL;DR: Slack, Rocket.chat, and Shell support, and you can write full chatterbots with Will now!  This is a huge rewrite of will, adding pluggable backends for chat systems, Will's internal brains, pub-sub, and encryption.    A huge number of really smart people gave their thoughts and suggestions throughout the process, not least  @hobson ,  @woohgit ,  @netjunki ,  @sivy ,  @antgel ,  @shadow7412 ,  @brandonsturgeon ,  @pepedocs ,  @tophsic , and  @mike-love .  Read all about what and why here:  What's new in Will 2 ,  And when you're ready to upgrade, here's  the upgrade guide . (Spoiler:  pip install -U will ).  High-level, here's what's new:   Slack support  CLI/Shell backend  Rocket.chat  support, thanks to  antgel .  Will's brains have been abstracted - you can now add custom  analysis ,  generation , and  execution  backends to build everything from a straight regex-bot to a full chatterbot.  Pluggable I/O backends , which is how all of the above were done, and which means adding new platforms is pretty simple.  Pluggable storage  backends.  Pluggable pubsub  backends.  Built-in encryption for storage and pub/sub (with  pluggable backends  as well.)  Lots more intelligence around required settings and verification, to make first starting and debugging Will easier.  Full Python 3 support. (Don't worry, 2.x  isn't going anywhere .)  New  @will gif me  command.  Because it can't all be serious. :)   This release also changes a few bits of behavior, to be consistent:   self.reply()   finally  no longer requires you to tediously pass the  message  back to it.  It's also smart, and backwards compatable with existing plugins.  admin_only  is explicitly flagged for deprecation and removal, to be replaced by the ACL system introduced in 2015 (largely, this is because having two different access control systems is crazy and painful.)  Switching is as easy as adding  ACL = {'admins': ['steven', 'will']}  to your config.py and find/replacing  admin_only=True  with `acl=['admins',] in your codebase.  For now, Will handles backwards compatibility by mapping the old settings into the new places, but he won't forever.  Thanks for updating, and making ongoing maintenence simpler!  If no ACLs are specified and users try to perform restricted commands, they'll be allowed as before, but Will will complain to the console. A new  DISABLE_ACL  setting has been added to turn off the complaining.  You can pass in  channel=  or  room=  when specifying a custom reply location.  If both are passed in, Will uses  channel .   There are a couple  internal  backwards-incompatible changes:   RosterMixin  has been renamed  HipChatRosterMixin  and moved to  will.backends.io_adapters.hipchat .  This change should not affect you unless you were specifically importing RosterMixin in your own plugins - everything in  WillPlugin  has been automatically routed to the right place, in a backwards-compatible way.  Room  and  RoomMixin  have similarly become  HipChatRoom  and  HipChatRoomMixin and moved to will.backends.io_adapters.hipchat`.   As this is a  big  update, please report any bugs you see (no matter how small) to  the github issue tracker .  Thanks in advance for making Will even better!",

At first, the statement really bugged me - but as I looked objectively at my own long list of abandoned open-source work, I realized there was a deep truth to it.\n\n\nWill has gone on a similar journey - it was written with the support from a couple of my day jobs, and after those left, my time dried up, and the project started to stagnate.\n\n\nThat stagnation has bugged me for a long time, but I didn't really have a way to solve the problem until now.\n\n\nWhat this document outlines is a future roadmap for Will that's both open-source and revenue-generating.  A project that can keep the codebase active, healthy, and adding new features (First up: Slack), while also paying my (and hopefully other folks') bills - and with some luck, maybe even changing the world.\n\n\nI recognize that a lot of people have contributed to will, and while many of you will be thrilled by the prospect of active, sustainable development, a few folks might have the \"OMG WHAT KIND OF SELL OUT BULL*** IS THIS??!?!\".   To those folks, I'd like to reiterate - Will is open-source, and is going to stay that way. :) \n\n\nNow let's talk about how.\n\n\nNote\n: I use the royal \"we\" below because it feels more natural in the long-term.  Right now it's just me and it's awkward.  Thanks for rolling with it.\n\n\nOverall Project Structure and Goals\n\n\nWill is being founded as a company, and with the core chat bot product, we'll have both the open-source library and a PaaS/SaaS service (ala Wordpress.com/.org).  The core of the company is around an idea we call Personal AI.\n\n\n(Read more about the mission at \nhttp://heywill.io/mission\n.)\n\n\nThis shift means growing the project to something much bigger than a hipchat bot, and into a write-once, run anywhere platform for chat bots, AIs, and fun new holy-crap-that's-amazing ideas.\n\n\nThe big goal is to provide an easy-to-build-on batteries-included platform that bridges modes of communication (HipChat, Slack, SMS, Email, Telegram, FB Messenger, etc) with services (IFTTT, Amazon AI, IBM Watson, Google APIs, etc) and built-in AI tools (NLP, ML, DL, etc).  \n\n\nThis broader platform serves as an OS for AI development, and has the tremendously creative working name of AIOS.\n\n\nDevelopers can build AIOS apps (our current plugins) for will using any and all of those tools, and run them on their personal wills or distribute them to a broader audience.\n\n\nWill the company will focus, like Wordpress, on running the PaaS and SaaS platforms, and a marketplace for apps.  Our goal is to keep Will development brisk, bring in talented folks across the spectrum, and keep Will available to anyone, anywhere on the planet, regardless of financial or technical access. \n\n\nProject Roadmap\n\n\nHere's the nuts and bolts of how, today, we see this rolling out.\n\n\n0.9.4 - Released April 25, 2017 - catches up almost all open PRs\n\n\n1.0 - Released September 29, 2017 closes up existing issues, code cleanup and prep for improvements\n\n\n2.0 - November 4, 2017 - Slack Support, \nIOBackend\n documented and working.  PRs for new IOs accepted.\n\n\n2.1 - A pure-python pubsub backend, Telegram Support, and a cleaned up API for introspecting and accessing the results of analysis and generation.\n\n\n2.2 - API Backend released, via an \nAPIBackend\n implementation of \nIOBackend\n.  Allows folks to spin up Will and control him completely via a RESTful API.\n\n\n2.3 - IFTTT Support, \nSkillsBackend\n documented and working.  PRs for new Skills accepted.\n\n\n2.5 - Will UI, with on-the-fly config, plugin enable/disable, and restartability.\n\n\n2.6 - App specs for AIOS and \nAIOSApp\n class released.\n\n\n2.7 - Release of first five apps. TBD, but considered: (Image me, Remind me, Groceries, News Summary, Scattegories, Stale Package Finder)\n\n\n3.0 - App Marketplace released, Git library integration released, and all existing Will plugins released as AIOS apps.\n\n\n2.0+ - \"The root of all evil is premature optimization.\"  Releases after 2.0 are likely to move in a direction of improved AIOS features, more built-in AI tools, smarter and richer message processing and context, cross-app communication, and speed/reliability bumps.  We'd also like to look at the feasibility of authoring apps in both Python and JS.  \n\n\nThat said, this will really be determined after 2.0 is released, the launch craziness settles down, and we hear from the community and customers which directions need the most support, and what pain points folks are feeling the most.\n\n\nWe can't wait to have those discussions.\n\n\nRelease Schedule.\n\n\nA new version of Will will be released on the 1st of every month, with a 12-month guarantee for \nIOBackend\n, \nSkillsBackend\n, API and AIOS APK function stability, and a minimum 6 month deprecation warning.\n\n\nQuestions and Comments\n\n\nI've set up an issue \nhere\n to talk through this new direction, hear people's thoughts, comments, suggestions, and feedback.\n\n\nI'm so excited to take will in this new, bigger direction, find consistent time and energy to keep him maintained, and grow him into something amazing together.\n\n\nThank you so much for contributing to will thus far, and I can't wait to see where we take him together!\n\n\n-Steven",
